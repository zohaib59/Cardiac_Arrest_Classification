# Cardiac Arrest Risk Prediction Case Study

Proud to share a case study where I built a synthetic patient dataset infused with medical logic to detect cardiac arrest risk 

üìä Trained 12 classifiers including XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM  
‚úÖ Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
üìà Overcame overfitting using domain-aware feature engineering

This project demonstrates how smart synthetic data paired with robust modeling can drive impactful decisions in healthcare AI 

This project aims to predict the likelihood of cardiac arrest based on synthetic patient data generated using domain-aware logic. 
We assess multiple classification algorithms to identify the most accurate and generalizable model.

- Fields include age, chest pain type, cholesterol, exercise-induced angina, max heart rate, ST depression, thalassemia, etc.
- Target variable: `Cardiac_Arrest_Risk` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow

1. Data Inspection and Cleanup
2. Outlier Detection and Visualizations
3. Class Distribution Analysis
4. Categorical Encoding
5. Train-Test Split (80/20)
6. Feature Scaling (where applicable)
7. Model Training using 12 classifiers
8. Performance Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)
9. Comparative Reporting and Interpretability (SHAP ready)

## üîç Models Included

- Logistic Regression, Ridge Classifier, Decision Tree
- Random Forest, Extra Trees, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM
- MLP Neural Network
- KNN, Naive Bayes (can be added optionally)
